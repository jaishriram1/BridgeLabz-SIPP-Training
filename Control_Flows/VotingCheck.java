//Question 13
//CP - Write a program to check whether a person can vote, depending on whether his/her age is greater than
//or equal to 18.
//Hint =>
//1. Get integer input from the user and store it in the age variable.
//2. If the person is 18 or older, print "The person can vote." Otherwise, print "The person cannot vote."
//I/P => age
//O/P =>
//If the person's age is greater or equal to 18 then the output is
//The person's age is ___ and can vote.
//Otherwise
//The person's age is ___ and cannot vote.
