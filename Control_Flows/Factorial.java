//Question 2
//CP - Write a Program to find the factorial of an integer entered by the user.
//Hint =>
//1. For example, the factorial of 4 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 which is 24.
//2. Take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable. Check the user has entered a positive
//integer.
//3. Using a while loop, compute the factorial.
//4. Print the factorial at the end.
